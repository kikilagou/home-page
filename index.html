           Hello!
            <p>I'm currently living in London, U.K. and working as a back-end software engineer at Publicis Sapient.</p>
            <p>I spend my time making art, taking photographs, running around Holborn, and writing code. I am also trying to write about my occasional attempts to replicate research I find interesting.</p>
            <p>If you'd like to have a look, here's my CV.</p>

            100 days of code.
            I wanted to challenge myself to create more things. I like to code, but I could be better at it. In fact, I love to code, and I really want to better at it!
            I came across the 100 days of code challenge during my training week at work, and it's perfect. Recently, I've started learning JavaScript, and my goal is to get to a level where I feel comfrotable as coding in JS as I do in Java or Python.
            There is a long way to go...I need to create a better plan for the projects I want to complete.
            So far I'd really like to get into using d3.js for some visualisation of open data. 
            I'd also very much like to build a Twitter bot and a mobile app.
            So far I am only working on my budgeting app project. I've hit the stage where I need to learn some new things to progress with it thought. So I am getting familiar with setting up user accounts.
